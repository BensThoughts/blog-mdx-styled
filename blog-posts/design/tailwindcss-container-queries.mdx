## Container Queries Are Coming!

Container queries are coming! Container queries are here! Container queries are awesome! Container
queries are still not supported by 35% of users browsers in late 2022‚Åâ Container queries are a new
feature that is going to greatly simplify our ability to make webpages look good on all screen sizes,
small to jumbo. You can find out more at [mdn web
docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@container) or
[css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/say-hello-to-css-container-queries/).

Currently in 2022 [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/?search=container%20queries) reports that only
65% of browsers support container queries. That means roughly 35% of users will not see your page
correctly if you use container queries without a fallback. That is **A LOT** of users that are going
to get a horrible experience.

## Considerations

If I want most users to have a great experience on my sites and I want to use container queries, a
fallback is going to be needed for each component that uses container queries.

I looked into using a polyfill such as
[container-query-polyfill](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/container-query-polyfill), but it was
becoming to complicated, had too many caveats, and would add more JS \(bloat\). Another consideration was
that my personal websites don't need to be perfectly identical for all users. I'm ok with showing a very
good layout to some users and a pitch perfect amazing layout to others. I just need my fallback to work
for **most** users. I would also like to be able to use tailwindcss because tailwind is highly scalable,
easy to update, and I already use it across multiple frameworks and sites that I run.

Fortunately tailwindcss already has a plugin/experimental feature to support container-queries. The
challenge is going to be coming up with a fallback that is dead simple, easy to maintain, and works for
most users. The solution is going to be to implement container queries and use media queries as a
fallback.

## Why Change At All?

You may be asking yourself why should I switch from media queries to container queries? While media
queries do a great job in most cases, there is always that one case where a mid-size screen mangles the
**content** layout a single component/card \(I'm looking at you iPad üòñ\). We could create an entirely
new breakpoint just to accommodate that one component, but that isn't what media queries are designed for. Media queries are designed to handle the layout of the page based on the screen size. They
are not designed to shift the layout of the **content** inside of a single component. There are lots of other
[reasons](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/on-container-queries/) to switch but this article is
about how to make the switch as easy and simple as possible.

## Initial Setup

The first step is to install tailwindcss and the container-queries plugin. There are good instruction
about how to [install tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) on the tailwindcss website
so I will not go over that here.

There are also good instructions about how to install the container-queries
plugin on the [github repo](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-container-queries). I will just
show the basic install command here. _Note: You must be using tailwindcss 3.2 or greater for this to
work_

<CommandLine
  command="npm"
  options="install"
  args="@tailwindcss/container-queries"
/>

Then add the plugin to your `tailwind.config.js`

```js:tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    // ...
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/container-queries'),
    // ...
  ],
}
```

## Using Tailwindcss Container Queries

This is pretty simple and explained well on the tailwind container queries plugin page. After installing
and setting everything up you can declare the parent container that you want to act as the container for
your query with `@container`. You can then conditionally style any children elements of that
parent using classes like `@lg:underline` or `@md:underline`. For more specific breakpoints you can use
square bracket notation such as `@[12.5rem]:text-purple` or `@[600px]:font-bold`. This last one will
give the text a bold color style if the parent container with the `@container` class is wider than 600px.
The `@md` and `@lg` are predefined in the plugin as 28rem and 32rem respectively and can be read about on the
[plugins github page](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-container-queries). This [Youtube
video](https://youtu.be/NoP9oY7kdy8) is quite good as well.

```html
<div class="@container">
  <div class="@lg:underline">
    <!-- This text will be underlined when the container is larger than `32rem` -->
  </div>
</div>
```

## Mixing Container and Media Queries

OK, we know how to create components to use container queries using tailwind. All we have to do now is
throw in our media queries and voila, browsers without support have media queries and those with support
will use container queries....maybe something like this...

```html:test
<div class="@container">
  <div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row @[600px]:flex-row">
    <!-- Some more divs here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

Actually, **this doesn't work!** The problem is that the media queries take precedent over the
container queries. Trying to implement both of them at the same time just ends up with all browsers
displaying the styles based on media queries and pretty much ignoring the container query. So all of that
work to make the elements flow in a row based on the container size is undone.

I tried using the `!important` keyword as well as changing the order of the classnames, but neither fixed
the issue.

---

## The Solution

The solution is to use [@supports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports) logic so
that media query based styles only apply when the browser doesn't support container queries. The logic
is...if the browser doesn't support container queries use media queries, else use container queries.

The good news is that tailwindcss has supported the @supports query since at least version 3.2. The bad
news is that the
[documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#supports-rules) does not make
it clear how to use it with the **_not_** keyword.

This is ultimately the html and css we want...

```css
/* use container query */
.container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

.some-component {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

/* use container query */
@container (min-width: 600px) {
  .some-component {
    flex-direction: row;
  }
}

/* use media query if container query not supported */
@supports not (container-type: inline-size) {
  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    .some-component {
      flex-direction: row;
    }
  }
}
```

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="some-component">
    <!-- Some more divs here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

That is actually kind of a lot of CSS to maintain, and it isn't very clear. To get this same code with
tailwindcss all we need to do is...

```html
<div class="@container">
  <div
    class="flex flex-col
           @[600px]:flex-row
           supports-[not(container-type:inline-size)]:md:flex-row"
  >
    <!-- Some more divs here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

I've broken up the class names for readability. The `@container` sets up the container we want to use for
our container query. The `@[600px]:flex-row` tells browsers that support container queries to change to
flex-row when the container is greater than 600px. Browsers that don't support container queries will
ignore this. The `supports-[not(container-type:inline-size)]:md:flex-row` tells browsers that don't
support container queries to use the `md:` medium screen size media query. While that supports-\[not..\]
line may look a little ugly it is actually quite maintainable and scalable compared to the css above.

## Caveats/Issues

While this is a pretty good solution, there are some caveats and issues you may run into.

The big caveat is that you may still end up with some funky stuff in the edge cases with users
who are using a browser that doesn't support container queries. There is also the fact that simply
testing if the browser supports `container-type: inline-size` may not be a completely fool proof solution
to determine if a browser fully supports container queries correctly.
