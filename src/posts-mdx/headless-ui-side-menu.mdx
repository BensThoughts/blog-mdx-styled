In this tutorial I am going to show you exactly how to build a drawer component using
[headless-ui](https://headlessui.dev/). &nbsp;We will utilize the modal component to
build the drawer.

## Installing headless-ui/tailwindcss

You will need to have headless-ui and tailwindcss installed to build the component.
&nbsp;I have listed the commands below. &nbsp;For further instructions check out the
official install pages linked to here &nbsp;[headless-ui
modal](https://headlessui.dev/react/dialog) &nbsp;[tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

<CommandLine
  title="install headless-ui"
  command="npm"
  options="install"
  args="@headlessui/react"
/>

<CommandLine
  title="install tailwindcss"
  command="npm"
  options="install -D"
  args="tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest"
/>
